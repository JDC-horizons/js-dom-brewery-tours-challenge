brewery app

state =
array => raw data: raw data returned from api
array => initial filtered data: raw data, filtered to include only tourable breweries
array => filters : filters. initially empty, data will be added by eventlisteners. render function refers here for advanced instruction.

filters: 
state - object, key with single value.
type - object, key with one value.
city - object, array with 1+ values.



function 1: initialise. 
> calls data from api, adds to state array 1.
> filters this data for tourable breweries and adds these to state array 2.
> no further action

function 2: render card.
> accepts a brewery object as input and renders card for it.
> will be used as callback by later functions, looping over an array and calling this for each object inside.

function 3: render page.
> no input.
> to be called by essentially every event listener.
> starts by defining an empty array to use - currentData = []
> checks state for filters, if found, filter data from state array 2 and add this to currentData. if no filters found, add all data from state array 2 to currentData.
